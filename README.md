# DateCapeProject

This app aims to simplify date night planning. 
The app will gather basic user information on the initial registration page: name and email address. 
The next screen will obtain the userâ€™s date night parameters: date of outing, activity interests (restaurants, events, local landmarks, etc) and zip code. 
The user will be provided with activity options based on their selections along with the weather conditions based on the zip code entered.
The app shall provide feedback by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. 

User Story:
AS A single person I WANT to have a tool to find date night activities SO THAT it simplifies and removes the stress of planning.
